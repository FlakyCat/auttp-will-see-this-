Emu is the daughter of the owner of Phoenix Wonderland, and grew up watching shows in the park. After seeing Tsukasa fail his audition, she hires him, along with Nene and Rui, to return the dilapidated Wonder Stage to its former glory. Emu wants to perform on the small Wonder Stage and keep it alive, as it was her late grandfather's favorite stage. She was inspired to make others smile by her grandfather, whom she greatly looks up to, though he passed two years before the main story.

Emu is a short girl with big sparkly pink eyes and pink hair cut into a short, messy bob. Her voice is bright and positive.

With a cheerful and somewhat naive personality, Emu is highly impulsive, acting on every idea that she comes up with, with a tendency to drag people around her into her plans. Emu has established her own personal catchphrase, "Wonderhoy!☆" (「わんだほーい!☆」), which she uses as a way to motivate herself and others. Though she is often in a joyful mood, Emu often neglects her more negative feelings, putting on a smile as to not worry those around her. Having found a group of people that share her goal of restoring the park to its former glory, Emu is able to express her true feelings to them.

Emu also seems to have a keen intuition when it comes to the sincerity of a person's expressions, as she is terrified of Mafuyu, noting that although Mafuyu is smiling on the outside, it doesn't feel "right". Though she seems airheaded, Emu is very smart and has placed in the top 3 of her school's exams.
